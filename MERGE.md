# RAG PDF Chat Implementation - Merge Instructions

## Overview
This feature branch implements a complete transformation of the chat application into a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for PDF question-answering.

## Changes Made

### Backend (`api/app.py`)
- **Complete rewrite** from simple OpenAI chat to RAG system
- **New endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/upload-pdf` - Upload and store PDF files
  - `POST /api/chat` - RAG-based question answering
  - `GET /api/status` - Check PDF upload and processing status
  - `DELETE /api/pdf` - Clear current PDF
- **New dependencies**: PyPDF2, numpy, python-dotenv
- **RAG implementation** using aimakerspace library components:
  - PDFLoader for text extraction
  - CharacterTextSplitter for chunking (1000 chars, 200 overlap)
  - VectorDatabase with OpenAI embeddings
  - Context-only response system

### Frontend (`frontend/app/components/ChatInterface.tsx`)
- **Complete interface redesign** for PDF-based chat
- **New features**:
  - Drag-and-drop PDF upload area
  - PDF status indicator with chunk count
  - Single question input (replaced dual developer/user inputs)
  - Visual processing indicators
  - Source count display for answers
- **Enhanced UX**:
  - Real-time status updates
  - Upload progress indicators
  - Context-aware placeholders and help text

### Dependencies (`api/requirements.txt`)
- Added PyPDF2==3.0.1
- Added numpy==1.24.3  
- Added python-dotenv==1.0.0

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ RAG System
- PDF content is chunked and embedded using OpenAI embeddings
- Vector similarity search retrieves top 3 relevant chunks per question
- LLM responds only based on provided context from PDF

### ✅ Context-Only Responses
- Strict prompt engineering ensures answers come only from PDF content
- Returns "I am not sure." when no relevant context is found
- No general knowledge responses allowed

### ✅ PDF Management
- Single PDF replacement system (upload new PDF replaces previous)
- Temporary in-memory storage during session
- Lazy loading (PDF processed on first question)

### ✅ Professional UI/UX
- Clean, modern interface with visual status indicators
- Drag-and-drop upload with file validation
- Real-time processing status
- Source attribution in responses

## Merge Instructions

### Option 1: GitHub Pull Request
1. Push the feature branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/rag-pdf-chat
   ```

2. Create a Pull Request:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select `feature/rag-pdf-chat` → `main`
   - Title: "feat: Transform chat app into RAG PDF question-answering system"
   - Add description with overview of changes
   - Review changes and merge when ready

### Option 2: GitHub CLI
1. Push the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/rag-pdf-chat
   ```

2. Create and merge PR using GitHub CLI:
   ```bash
   # Create PR
   gh pr create --title "feat: Transform chat app into RAG PDF question-answering system" \
                --body "Implements complete RAG system for PDF-based Q&A using aimakerspace library. See MERGE.md for details." \
                --base main --head feature/rag-pdf-chat

   # Review and merge (optional)
   gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch
   ```

### Option 3: Direct Git Merge (Local)
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge feature branch
git merge feature/rag-pdf-chat

# Push to origin
git push origin main

# Clean up feature branch (optional)
git branch -d feature/rag-pdf-chat
git push origin --delete feature/rag-pdf-chat
```

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### 2. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Testing Workflow
1. Set OpenAI API key
2. Upload a PDF file (drag-and-drop or click to browse)
3. Wait for processing (status will show "Ready for questions")
4. Ask questions about the PDF content
5. Verify responses are context-only

### 4. Expected Behavior
- ✅ Questions with relevant PDF content → Detailed answers with source count
- ✅ Questions with no relevant content → "I am not sure."
- ✅ General knowledge questions → "I am not sure."

## Architecture Notes

### Data Flow
1. **PDF Upload** → Extract text → Split into chunks → Generate embeddings → Store in vector DB
2. **User Question** → Generate question embedding → Search vector DB → Retrieve top 3 chunks → Generate context-aware response

### Security Considerations
- User-provided OpenAI API keys (no server-side key storage)
- File size limit: 50MB
- PDF-only file validation
- Temporary in-memory storage (no persistent file storage)

### Performance
- Lazy PDF processing (only on first question)
- Efficient vector similarity search
- Optimized chunk size for embedding context

**Branch**: `feature/rag-pdf-chat`  
**Ready for merge**: ✅ All tests passing, no linting errors  
**Breaking changes**: ⚠️ Complete API and UI redesign - not backward compatible
