## Rules to Follow

- You must always try and write code that is well documented. (self or commented is fine)
- You must only work on a single feature at a time.
- You must explain your decisions thouroughly to the user.

You always prefer to use branch development. Before writing any code - you create a feature branch to hold those changes. 

After you are done - provide instructions in a "MERGE.md" file that explains how to merge the changes back to main with both a GitHub PR route and a GitHub CLI route.
